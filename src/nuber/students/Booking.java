/**

 * Booking represents the overall "job" for a passenger getting to their
 * destination.
 *
 * It begins with a passenger, and when the booking is commenced by the region
 * responsible for it, an available driver is allocated from dispatch. If no
 * driver is
 * available, the booking must wait until one is. When the passenger arrives at
 * the destination,
 * a BookingResult object is provided with the overall information for the
 * booking.
 *
 * The Booking must track how long it takes, from the instant it is created, to
 * when the
 * passenger arrives at their destination. This should be done using Date class'
 * getTime().
 *
 * Booking's should have a globally unique, sequential ID, allocated on their
 * creation.
 * This should be multi-thread friendly, allowing bookings to be created from
 * different threads.
